## Navier-Stokes equation

The Navierâ€“Stokes momentum equation can be derived as a particular form of the Cauchy momentum equation, whose general convective form is \cite{constantin1988navier}: 

$${\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {u} }{Dt}}={\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf {g} } {\frac  {D{\mathbf  {u}}}{Dt}}={\frac  1\rho }\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol  {\sigma }}+{\mathbf  {g}}$$ {#eq:NS}

You can also use acronyms, like \DNA, or terms, like \cell, that must be defined in the glossaries index (e.g. in `_data` folder).
